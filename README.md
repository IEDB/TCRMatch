# TCRMatch v1.0
### Maintainer: Austin Crinklaw
#### Please open any issues on Github, or feel free to email acrinklaw(at)lji(dot)org with feedback or concerns


## Requirements:
- Linux OS
- Python 3 (to generate certain output)
- CMake (if you wish to compile from source)

## Installation:
Please download TCRMatch from the latest release.
If you wish to compile from source, simply clone the repo and run
```shell
cmake . && cmake --build .
```


## Usage:
### Input  
-  A text file containing newline separated CDR3beta amino acid sequences
  ```
ASSLRWGDEQY
SADRVGNTLY
ASSFGREQY
ASSQDQVQDTQY
ASSPGQGPYEQY
ATSSGTGAYEQY
ASEAGGSYEQY
ASGDRGADTQY
ASSQAGAYEQY
  ```

To generate the initial scores, please run
```shell
./tcrmatch -i input_file -t num_threads > output_file
```
- -i specifies the path to the input file
- -t specifies the number of threads to use if operating on more than 1 core

To generate the output format which contains information regarding epitopes, receptor groups, antigens and source organisms, navigate to the "scripts" folder and run the process_output.py file.
```shell
python process_output.py input_file output_file
```
where input_file refers to the file generated by the ./tcrmatch command, and output_file is the file you wish to store the full output to.

To update the IEDB_data.tsv file located in the data folder, navigate to the scripts directory and simply run
```
./update.sh
```
This creates an archive folder in the top directory "data_archive" and moves the current IEDB_data.tsv file to said directory. This file will be renamed to the current day_month_year_IEDB_data.tsv, and a new version will be downloaded
to data/IEDB_data.tsv.


### Output  
-  Output file has 7 columns in TSV format. 
-  First column is the user provided input sequence.  
-  Second column contains a CDR3beta sequence from the IEDB scoring higher than the threshold
-  The third column contains the score based on the kernel similarity metric (ranging from threshold to .99)
- The fourth column contains the epitopes associated with the matched IEDB sequence. If there are multiple, they will be comma separated.
- The fifth column contains the receptor groups (these can be used to reference the sequences back to the IEDB. If the receptor group is 12843, you can find all the receptors associated by visiting https://iedb.org/receptor/12843)
- The sixth column contains the name of the specific antigen for the matched receptor
- The seventh column contains the name of the source organism for the antigen

The last two columns are not always available depending on the data that was curated.

*Note that due to the trimming of IEDB CDR3b sequences, there may be multiple receptor groups that map to the same trimmed sequence. In these cases, the receptor groups will be comma separated and each link to their own unique receptor on the IEDB.

## How it works:
- TCRMatch implements a similarity metric as defined in [arXiv:1205.6031v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6031v2)
- Each input sequence is compared to all TCR CDR3beta sequences characterized in the IEDB
- Sequences that have a  score greater than the threshold (.97 by default) are returned as matches
